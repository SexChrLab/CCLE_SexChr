# TCGA Ploidy Expression Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focusing on the expression of genes located on the X and Y chromosomes. The analysis aims to explore how the expression levels of these genes vary with ploidy status.

## Contents
1. **RMarkdown Files**
   - `TCGA_Ploidy_Expression_Categories.Rmd`: Generates stacked bar plots that illustrate the counts of Y and X chromosome gene expressions categorized by their respective ploidy statuses.

2. **Data**
   - `SA1_male_LoY_TCGA.csv`: Gene expression dataset for male samples with Y chromosome status, sourced from the supplemental material of Qi, M., Pang, J., Mitsiades, I., Lane, A. A., & Rheinbay, E. (2023). Loss of Chromosome Y in Primary Tumors. Cell, 186(14).
   - `SA2_female_LoX_TCGA.csv`: Gene expression dataset for female samples with X chromosome status, also sourced from the same supplemental material.
   - `inferred_sex_chromosome_complement.csv`: Output from TCGA Inferred Sex Chromosome Complements Determination

3. **Output**
   - Generated plots in PDF format, saved in the output directory.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following R packages installed:
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `readr`
- `tidyverse`

## How to Run the Analysis
1. **Set the Working Directory**
   Update the paths in the RMarkdown file to point to the correct directories on your system.

2. **Load the Data**
   The data is loaded from CSV files. Ensure that the specified paths in the `data_directory` variable are correct.

3. **Execute the RMarkdown File**
   You can run the analysis in RStudio by opening the RMarkdown file and clicking on the "Knit" button to generate an HTML report.

## Analysis Steps
### Step 1: Data Loading and Cleaning
- Load the male and female gene expression data from TCGA and the supplemental table.
- Merge and clean the datasets, retaining only the relevant columns for analysis.

### Step 2: Generate Plots
- Create stacked bar plots for Y chromosome gene expressions categorized by Y ploidy for males.
- Create stacked bar plots for X chromosome gene expressions categorized by X ploidy for females.
- Save the generated plots in the output directory.

## Output
- Violin plots showing Y and X gene expressions vs ploidy statuses.
- Stacked bar plots showing counts of Y and X expressions categorized by ploidy statuses.
