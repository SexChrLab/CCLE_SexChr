# TCGA Sex Chromosome Gene Expression Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes RNAseq data from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, focusing on gene expression related to the **X** and **Y chromosomes**. The analysis aims to compare the expression levels of Y pseudoautosomal genes like **DDX3Y**, and **XIST**, infer sex chromosome complements, and explore the relationships between gene expression levels and sex chromosome complements across various cancers.

## Contents

1. **RMarkdown Files**
   - `tcga_gbm_only.Rmd`: Analyzes glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) RNAseq data, focusing on sex chromosome gene expression between solid tissue normal and primary tumor samples.
   - `TCGA_Sex_Chromosome_Genes_TPM.Rmd`: Downloads and processes TPM data for sex chromosome genes across all cancers.
   - `TCGA_Thresholds_Determination.Rmd`: Establishes threshold levels for relevant gene expression differences by sex.
   - `TCGA_Inferred_Sex_Chromosome_Complements.Rmd`: Infers sex chromosome complements from RNAseq data across cancers.
   - `TCGA_Pie_Charts_by_Cancers.Rmd`: Generates pie charts visualizing gene expression by cancer types and gender, excluding gender-specific cancers.

2. **Data**
   - RNAseq TPM data pulled from the TCGA database for sex chromosome genes.
   - Inferred sex chromosome complements for all samples based on gene expression analysis.
   
3. **Output**
   - Plots (PDF and PNG format) generated from the analysis, saved in the `output` directory.
   - Tables of inferred sex chromosome complements and thresholds for gene expression.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following R packages are installed before running the analysis:
- `TCGAbiolinks`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Set the Working Directory**
   Ensure that the file paths in the RMarkdown files point to the correct directories on your system. Update paths where necessary.

2. **Download RNAseq Data**
   Use the `TCGA_Sex_Chromosome_Genes_TPM.Rmd` file to pull down TPM data from the TCGA database, focusing on sex chromosome genes (e.g., DDX3Y, XIST).

3. **Analyze Gene Expression**
   Use the RMarkdown files to:
   - Determine thresholds for significant expression levels.
   - Infer sex chromosome complements based on gene expression levels.

4. **Generate Visualizations**
   Visualize the relationship between gene expression and sex chromosome complements using `TCGA_Pie_Charts_by_Cancers.Rmd`. This script creates pie charts by cancer type and gender, excluding gender-specific cancers.

5. **Execute the RMarkdown Files**
   Open each RMarkdown file in RStudio and click the "Knit" button to generate HTML reports.

## Output

- **PDF/PNG Files**: Visualizations of gene expression across cancers, saved in the `output` directory.
- **Inferred Sex Chromosome Complements**: A table summarizing inferred sex chromosome complements for all TCGA samples.
- **Thresholds**: Tables defining significant gene expression thresholds for further analysis.
