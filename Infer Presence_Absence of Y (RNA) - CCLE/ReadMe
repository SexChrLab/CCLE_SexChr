# CCLE Sex Chromosome Gene Expression Analysis

This folder contains the code and data used to infer the presence or absence of X and Y chromosomes in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) cell lines. This analysis leverages RNA-seq expression data for sex chromosome genes such as **XIST**, **RPS4Y1**, **ZFY**, **DDX3Y**, and others. It also includes visualization and reporting through heat maps, violin plots, and pie charts.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the expression of sex chromosome genes, specifically focusing on how the expression relates to reported sex in the CCLE cell lines. The analysis aims to provide insights into the expression patterns of genes on the X and Y chromosomes and infer the presence of these chromosomes based on gene expression data.

## Data Preparation

Gene expression data is obtained from CCLE, with TPM values log-transformed. **Ensembl gene IDs** are converted to **HGNC symbols** using the BiomaRt package.

### Input Files:
1. **Gene Expression Data**: `CCLE_RNAseq_rsem_genes_tpm_20180929.txt`
2. **Sample Annotation Data**: `Cell_lines_annotations_20181226.txt`
3. **Gene Location Data**: `gene_locations.csv`

## Outputs

1. **Heatmaps**:
    - `CCLE_complete_heat_map_scaled.pdf`: Shows all genes of interest, split by sex and gene location.
    - `CCLE_refined_heat_map_scaled.pdf`: Focuses on a subset of selected genes with significant bimodal expression.

2. **Violin Plots**:
    - **By Reported Sex**: 
        - Individual gene expression plots (male/female) with thresholds.
        - Combined facet violin plot: `facet_plot_with_thresholds.pdf`
    - **By Tissue Type**:
        - `XIST_violin_plot_females_by_tissue_and_cancer.pdf`: Visualizes XIST expression in female cell lines across different tissues.
        - `DDX3Y_violin_plot_males_by_tissue_and_cancer.pdf`: Visualizes DDX3Y expression in male cell lines across different tissues.
        - Variants with tissue separators:
            - `XIST_violin_plot_females_with_separators.pdf`
            - `DDX3Y_violin_plot_males_with_separators.pdf`

3. **Pie Charts**:
    - **Female Cell Lines**:
        - `CCLE_female_inclusive_pie_chart.pdf`
        - `CCLE_female_conservative_pie_chart.pdf`
    - **Male Cell Lines**:
        - `CCLE_male_inclusive_pie_chart.pdf`
        - `CCLE_male_conservative_pie_chart.pdf`

4. **CSV Output**:
    - `CCLE_individual_scc.csv`: Contains the sex chromosome complements and expression data for each cell line.


## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the expression of sex chromosome genes in the CCLE. The generated heat maps, violin plots, pie charts, and tables can be used to explore how gene expression correlates with reported sex and infer the presence of sex chromosomes.
