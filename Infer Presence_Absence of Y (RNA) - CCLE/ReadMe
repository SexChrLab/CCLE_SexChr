# Infer Presence or Absence of Y (RNA)

## Establishing Thresholds for Analysis

This code allows the visualization of expression data in the CCLE. Only cell lines with a reported sex are included in the data. Violin plots with and without thresholds and pie charts for males and females are created. Each cell line is then annotated with "high_expression", "intermediate_expression", or "low_expression" according to the assigned thresholds. This will output as a csv with expression (RNA-seq) counts, log counts, and the expression level. The total output is one violin plot with thresholds image, two pie chart images (one for female, one for male), and one csv file.

**This code is made to run one gene at a time.** To run different Y chromosome genes, change "chosen_gene" under Gene of Interest. This may be used for X chromosome genes as well. Change the chosen_gene and use male mean and standard deviation when calculating thresholds.

*Change* working_directory *and* data_directory *accordingly.*
